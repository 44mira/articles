# Functional Patterns: The Monoid

> Trigger Warning: this article contains Haskell codeblocks!

## Introduction

As a programmer, I've always found myself obssessing over patterns I
could find in the code I write. From simple ones such as the Gaussian
sum and early returns, to ones that hold a bit more complexity such as the
Strategy pattern.

I find satisfaction in finding elegant ways to express
recurring needs and results, which has ultimately led me to my exploration
of the **Functional Programming** paradigm. And so, early in 2023, in my
freshmen of college, I decided to undergo the massive undertaking that is,
*learning Haskell*.

I'm not going to bore you on the details that is learning a language which is
meant to unapologetically academic as I believe I am still not that good
at it yet, but I have picked up the patterns that I had been searching for in
the first place, which is a win in my book.

I plan to have this as the first article of more elegant patterns I've found
from my months of studying functional programming.
